# Benchmark 3. Benchmark on the integration of stakeholders in a design process for the sustainability of a complex system
This benchmark is under construction. So not all the sections are completed (especially the cartography)
The main goal of this bencharmk is to be able to compare different ways of measuring the value perceived by the stakeholders: ecosystems, territorial approaches, value analysis approaches, etc.

## Glossary
To share a common understanding of ambiguous concepts, contributors shall agree upon the following definitions:
- Value : « needs / costs » (NF EN 1325:2014-04)
- Sustainability : definition of (Brundtland 1987) which is very classic and strong and weak sustainability, based on (Pelenc, Ballet & Dedeurwaerder, 2015)
- Stakeholders : “any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization‘s objectives” (Freeman, 1984)
- Complex system: definition by (Cook-Davies & al., PMI, 2011) which is based on uncertainty, particularly related to changes of context (PP)) (other existing definitions)

## Requirements
The objective of the benchmark is to compare several approaches to measure the value provided to PPs in a design for sustainability process that integrates PPs. The analysis is based on the perception of the Stakeholders with the question: how to measure the contribution of the system for the PPs?

## Solutions to be compared
### Solution 1 : New value approach
The approach detailed in this sheet is the approach called "New Value Approach" (a source on Alexis Lalevée thesis or work will be added in the next weeks/months). This approach combines different tools which are described in the following list:
* The Stakeholder Value Network (SVN) measures perceived value: the contribution
* The Donut economy model (Raworth, 2012) measures the socio-ecological performance of the system
* The value analysis (VA) makes it possible to measure the technical and economic performance of the system

Other solutions can be added here. For instance, someone working on the ecosystem approach could compare this method with the "New value approach".

## Measures of Performance
* Sustainability approaches :
  * Number of elements of the "Donut" processed: "limits" and "thresholds"
  * Sustainability approach used: weak or strong?
* Stakeholder involvement :
  * project success rate (%): comparison of methods
  * project implementation time (days): time between launch and the milestone of choice of the solution (s)
* Overall price of the study (€)
* Satisfaction of PP (final design result) with an average overall rating

More precise elements are arriving soon!

## Datasets
### Dataset 1
Link to the descriptive PDF file of the case study (stakeholders_case_study.pdf).
NDV (or other approaches) should be applied to the case study.

## Cartography
The cartogaphy is not yet available. It will be available as soon as Alexis Lalevée defends his PhD!! We wish him good luck!!
